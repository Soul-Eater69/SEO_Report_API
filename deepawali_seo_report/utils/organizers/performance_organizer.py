The Title will appear in the Header Bar of a user's browser. It is also one of the most important (and easiest to improve) On-Page SEO factors.\nWe recommend setting a keyword rich Title between 10â€“70 characters. This is often simple to enter into your CMS system or may need to be manually set in the header section of the HTML code."
